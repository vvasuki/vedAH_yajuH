      <description>The Śrautasūtras are an important part of the Kalpa Vedānga. They deal with the ritual called Śrauta for which the performer must be an āhitāgni (i.e, one who has established the three sacred fires). An āhitāgni is basically a married man belonging to one of the three classes viz. Brāhmaṇa, Ksatriya or Vaiśya. When a man belonging to one of these classés gets married it becomes obligatory on his part to worship the fire in the presence of which he got married.</description>

      <description>(2) The Śrauta-rituals are mainly of two types: i) Havir yajñas (Iṣṭis) and ii) Somayajñas. The New and Full-moon sacrifies (Darsapūrṇamāsau) form the basic paradigm of the Havir-yajñas. Agnistoma forms the basic paradigm of the Soma Sacrifices. The Somayajñas are divided into three categories which are based upon the duration of the performance as well as peculiarities of the performance as such: i) Ekāha one-day sacrifices; ii) Ahīna: sacrifices being performed for two to twelve days iii) Sattra: Sacrifices being performed for twelve days or more number of days.</description>

      <description>(3) The Veda has different branches (sākhās) and accor dingly there are different Śrautasūtras belonging to different vedic branches. It is well-known that may branches are now known only through the names and the literature belonging to these branches is now not available. At present following Śrauta sūtras are available.
R̥gveda: Āśvalāyana and Śāṅkhāyana. They describe the duties of the Hotr̥ and his assistants. White Yajurveda has Kātyāyana-Śrautasūtra which describes the duties of the Adhvaryu and his assistants.</description>

      <description>(4) The three Śrautasutras of the Taittirīya-Branch of the Black Yajurveda viz. Bhāradvāja, Āpastamba and Satyāṣāḍha Hiraṇyakeśin form one group. Bhāradvāja is sometimes more concise but by and large these three Śrautasūtras very much similar to each other as far as the ritualistic details, style and vocabulary are considered. In comparision to Baudhāyana, they are less diffuse and more concise. They also contain many references to the other schools. Therefore they are more rich than Baudhāyana as far as the contents are considered.</description>

      <description>(5) Āpastamba probably belonged to a period later than that of Bhāradvāja. They are very similar to each other in style, structure and order of subjects (except a few details). Sometimes even the wording in both the texts is identical. Āpastamba&amp;rsquo;s rules are at times ampler and somewhat curious.
Āpastamba, like Baudhāyana places Mantras before injunctions. In this respect, he differs from Bhāradvāja.+++(4)+++ Apastamba quotes more authorities than Bhāradvāja.
Āpastamba quotes the views of Āśmarathya and Ālekhana.</description>

      <description>(7) It will be thus seen that Āpastambaśrautasūtra is a model of Taittiriya-manual containing numerous aspects of Vedic ritual although there are some problems regarding the complicated relations between the Sūtras and its basic texts (contrast Gonda, The Ritual Sūtras, I. 521). This text has been critically edited alongwith the commentary of Rudradatta by R Garbe in three volumes (Calcutta, 1882, 1885, and 1902). This edition was re-edited by C. G.</description>

      <description>(8) There is a general agreement among the scholars in connection with the place and time the Āpastambaírautasūtra. It has been accepted by scholars that Āpastamba belonged to the Āndhra-region in the South India. He might have lived not later than the fifth century B.C. His work is one of the comparatively younger works but not one of the youngest works (cf. Garbe vol. III. p. XV-XVI).</description>

      <description>(9) The language and style of the Āpastambaśrautasūtra has a lot of similarity with those of the classical Sanskrit. But still there are some peculiarities and archaisms in the text. Būhler has rightly observed that the ritualists in general were deficient in their education (ZDMG, XL, p. 705). This is correct in later times as well as modern times also.+++(5)+++
In Āpastamba-srautasūtra the optative third person singular takes yita rather than yeta 16.</description>

      <description>(10) I draw the attention of the readers to the translation of the following text places from the Āpastamba-srautasūtra in this work:
VIII.18.5; IX.4.11; IX.14.11; X.5.11-13; X.24.3; XII.5.6; XIII.13.9; XIV.22.13; XVI.35.10; XVII.5.3; XVIII.7.8; XVIII.8.14; XVIII.8.19; XVIII.19.8; XVIII.22.3; XIX. 15.9; XX.25.1; XXI.3.3; XXII.2.23; XXII.14.22; XXIII.7.7.
Everywhere I translate the word Puroḍāśa with the English Expression “bread&amp;quot;. Generally the translators in English German, French use the word “cake” or a corresponding word to “cake”.</description>
