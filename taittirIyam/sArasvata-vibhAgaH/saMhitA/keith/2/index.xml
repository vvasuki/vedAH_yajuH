      <description>01 Prajapati created offspring. On their creation Indra and Agni hid them away. Prajapati reflected, &amp;lsquo;Indra and Agni have hidden away from me offspring.&amp;rsquo; He then perceived this offering to Indra and Agni on eleven potsherds, and offered it, and the two (gods) restored offspring to him. Indra and Agni indeed conceal his offspring, who being fit for offspring, yet obtains not offspring; so let a man who desires offspring offer a sacrifice to Indra, and Agni on eleven potsherds.</description>

      <description>01 He who desires prosperity should offer to the Adityas, giving prosperity; it is the Adityas who repel from prosperity him who being fit for prosperity does not obtain prosperity; verily he has recourse to the Adityas, giving prosperity, with their own share; verily they make him attain prosperity; he becomes prosperous. He who has been expelled or is being expelled should offer an oblation to the Adityas, the sustainers; the Adityas are the expellers, the Adityas are the procurers; verily he has recourse to the Adityas, the sustainers [1] with their own share; verily they support him in the people; he is unexpellable.</description>

      <description>01 The gods, men, and the Pitrs were on one side, the Asuras, Raksases, and Piśacas on the other. Of the gods the little blood they drew the Raksases smothered by the nights and dawn dawned on them smothered and dead. The gods understood, &amp;lsquo;Him who of us dies, it is the Raksases who kill.&amp;rsquo; They invited the Raksases; they said, &amp;lsquo;Let us choose a boon; what [1] we win from the Asuras, let that be shared between us.</description>

      <description>The Part of the Hotr at the New and Full Moon Sacrifices
07 The gods could not rest on the Rc or the Yajus. On the Saman only could they rest. He makes the noise &amp;lsquo;Him&amp;rsquo;; verily he makes the Saman. He makes the noise &amp;lsquo;Him&amp;rsquo;; where the gods rested, there he sets them in motion. He makes the noise &amp;lsquo;Him&amp;rsquo;; this is the yoking of speech. He makes the noise &amp;lsquo;Him&amp;rsquo;; thus the sacrificers produce offspring.</description>

The Part of the Hotr in the New and Full Moon Sacrifice
07 Manu desired what of earth was sacrificial. He found the poured out ghee. He said, &amp;lsquo;Who is able to produce this also at the sacrifice?&amp;rsquo; Mitra and Varuna said, &amp;lsquo;We are able to produce the cow.&amp;rsquo; Then they set the cow in motion. Wherever she stepped, there ghee was pressed out; therefore she is called ghee-footed; that is her origin.</description>
