In which was born Kaśyapa, in which Indra,
They have conceived Agni as a germ, of varied forms; May these waters be gentle and kindly to us.
b Those in whose midst Varuna doth go,
Gazing on the truth and falsehood of men,
Dripping honey, pure, purifying;
May these waters be gentle and kindly to us.
c Those of which in the sky the gods make their food, Those that are in many places in the sky,</description>

With a Gayatri (verse) addressed to Agni should he stroke the first layer; with a Tristubh the second; with a Jagati the third; with an Anustubh the fourth; with a Pankti the fifth; verily he piles the fire according to the deity.</description>
